  {
    q: 'What areas do you serve for window cleaning?',
    a: 'World Wide Window Co serves homeowners and properties throughout Washington State, Oregon State, and Idaho. Whether you\'re in a major metro area like Seattle, Portland, or Boise, or in a smaller community, we provide the same premium residential window cleaning service across the entire Pacific Northwest tri-state region.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much does professional residential window cleaning cost?',
    a: 'Pricing depends on the number of windows, stories, home size, and level of soiling. World Wide Window offers free, no-obligation quotes — call us or fill out our online form to get an exact quote for your home.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does residential window cleaning take?',
    a: 'A standard residential window cleaning takes 1–3 hours depending on the number of windows, stories, and level of soiling. Most single-family homes are completed in under 2 hours. We always provide a time estimate before starting so you can plan your day.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is professional window cleaning really worth it?',
    a: 'Absolutely. Windows accumulate dust, hard water deposits, pollen, and seasonal grime that DIY methods miss. Professional cleaning removes this buildup, increases natural light by up to 40%, boosts curb appeal, and protects your glass long-term. Most homeowners book recurring service once they see the results.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What does your residential window cleaning include?',
    a: 'Our standard residential service includes interior and exterior cleaning of all windows, with screen cleaning and track cleaning available, and spotless polishing using a pure water system. We also offer add-ons such as hard water stain removal and gutter cleaning.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How often should I have my windows professionally cleaned?',
    a: 'Most residential clients benefit from professional cleaning every 2–4 months. Homes near trees, high-traffic roads, or dusty areas may benefit from more frequent service. We offer recurring service plans for regular customers.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you clean interior and exterior windows?',
    a: 'Yes. Our standard residential service includes both interior and exterior window cleaning, along with screen cleaning available and sill wipe-downs available. We can also do exterior-only service if preferred. Just let us know when you request your quote.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are your cleaning products safe for children, pets, and plants?',
    a: 'Yes. Our primary cleaning method uses a pure water purification system that cleans with purified water and professional-grade squeegees, minimizing chemical use. Any supplemental cleaning agents we use are carefully selected to be safe around your home, family, and landscaping.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the window cleaning process from start to finish?',
    a: 'We start with a free quote and assessment. On service day, we arrive on time, confirm the scope of work, pre-treat any heavy staining, then clean with professional squeegees and a purified water system for a spotless finish. We clean sills and tracks, conduct a full walk-through with you, and stand behind the result with our satisfaction guarantee.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you remove hard water stains from windows?',
    a: 'Yes. Hard water stain removal is one of our specialties. Using professional-grade mineral and calcium removers, we can restore clarity to heavily stained glass. Most stains are fully removed in a single treatment. For severely etched glass, we offer a polishing treatment option.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you offer commercial window cleaning?',
    a: 'Yes. While our primary focus is residential, we do offer commercial window cleaning for storefronts and smaller office buildings across Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Contact us for a commercial quote.',
